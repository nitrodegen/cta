# cta
C To Assembly ( cta ) is a language translator,that translates C language to x86_64 Assembly
(my attempt at creating a basic compiler.)


<h1>How does cta work? </h1>

<br>cta translates every C line into x86_64 assembly instruction.
<br>well i mean not every , for loop works, printf ,scanf, if-else. good for basic stuff 
<br>Built in C++ , using.. well using C++ , i used what i learned to do it, so i all credit goes to me xd.</br>
<h1>changelog</h1>
<h3>Version 1.0a</h3>
<br><b>Established basic functions like printf, scanf
<br>Also added int declaration , and completed the code.</b></br>
<h3>Version 1.1a</h3>
<br><b>Added for loops.
<br>fixed memory leak by replacing string* array  with vector<string> array (thanks reddit.) </b></br>
<h3>What doesn't work on cta?</h3>
<br>this is a tough one , i mean , when i added for loops , now you can't execute anything after for loop, that was in for loop.
<br>and i currently cannot fix that , so take it or leave it.
<br>Int declaration basically works for everything... don't ask me anything. i do have to fix that , i just have to find more time to do it.</br>
